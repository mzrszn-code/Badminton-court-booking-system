## Introduction
The badminton court booking system developed by Group Flotilla is designed to modernize and enhance the overall process of reserving sports facilities within an organization. Traditional booking methods often lead to issues such as double bookings, miscommunication, forgotten reservations, and difficulties for administrators in managing peak hours or monitoring court usage. Recognizing these challenges, this web-based system aims to provide a structured, reliable, and user-friendly solution that supports both users and administrators in managing the facility efficiently.

The system integrates a variety of functional components that work together to deliver a seamless booking experience. Users are able to check real-time court availability, view schedules in a calendar format, update their personal information, and track their entire booking history in one centralized platform. To ensure that users stay informed and avoid last minute confusion, the application also incorporates automatic email notifications for booking confirmations, approvals, rejections, and reminders sent two hours before scheduled sessions. These features promote better communication and reduce the likelihood of missed or forgotten bookings.

From an administrative perspective, the system includes advanced tools such as a dedicated dashboard displaying usage statistics, commonly booked courts, and peak booking times. This allows administrators to make data driven decisions regarding facility management. In addition, administrators can activate maintenance mode for specific courts, ensuring users are prevented from booking courts that are temporarily unavailable. The introduction of a QR code check-in system further enhances operational efficiency by enabling quick verification of approved bookings.

Overall, this booking system is designed not only to streamline the reservation process but also to improve transparency, accountability, and user satisfaction. By combining automation, real-time information, and a structured management interface, the system serves as a comprehensive digital solution for managing badminton court facilities effectively.
